# WaifuRandomizer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

This is a simple Angular 7 application that takes submitted form data and uses it to create a randomized female character. Use it for art or writing prompts!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploying

Use `npm run deploy` to create a `docs` folder that you can deploy to a website. It contains all of the necessary JSON files required to run the randomizer.
